# SARemix-Installer
There's the source code of the app, vsc + python extension and you can compile it yourself if you prefer, release has an already compiled one tho for the lazy/not nerd enough.

With the app you can go from a clean GTA SA install to a fully working remixed one with Hemry's and I mod + all necessary's mod to fix issues the game has when using remix and of course remix runtime.

For the remix runtime part, it just downloads the latest release stable version, if there is updates on the bridge or dxvk that are needed, it will need to be done by hand, this is more a way for people that just want to play to have a simpler access to all that complicated part of modding.

You can also update each of them separately.

Discord : yanisselt  or just come here https://discord.gg/rtxremix in GTA SA channel if you have any question about the app or the mod.

Enjoy the mod !
